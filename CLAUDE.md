# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a calculus educational notes repository covering Chapter 5: Integration. It contains Markdown files originally authored in Obsidian.

## Structure

Four sequential sections on integration:
- Section 5.2: The Definite Integral
- Section 5.3: Riemann Sums
- Section 5.4: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- Section 5.5: Numerical Integration

## Conventions

- Standard GitHub-flavored Markdown with URL-encoded links (e.g., `[Section 5.4](Section%205.4%20...md)`)
- Math expressions use LaTeX notation within `$...$` (inline) and `$$...$$` (display)
- Images stored in `images/` folder, referenced as `![alt](images/Figure%20Name.png)`
- Obsidian-style callouts (`> [!tip]`, `> [!note]`, etc.) are used but render as blockquotes on GitHub
